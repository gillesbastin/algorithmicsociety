excerpt:    "Society is experiencing an unprecedented algorithmic turn. The Algorithmic Society Chair will take a triple challenge to understand this turn : an empirical challenge by studying AI in its immediate social settings, an experimental challenge by proposing innovative cross-disciplinary research on biases in AI and a cultural challenge by fostering a new AI literacy among social science students."
